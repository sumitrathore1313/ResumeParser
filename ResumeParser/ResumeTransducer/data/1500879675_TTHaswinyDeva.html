Business Intern at Hays
</p>
<p>6 people have recommended TT Haswiny
"Do you wish your HR department had an individual who is able to understand everyone quickly? Haswiny
is that person. Haswiny surprised me countless times with her interpersonal skills as a Resident Advisor
working alongside me. Her conflict resolution skills, innate understanding of individual motivations, and
her strong work ethic will make her an incredible asset to any company's HR department. Even if your HR
department currently has enough talent, you would be well advised to invest in Haswiny--do not miss the
opportunity. If you are looking to build your HR team--I recommend you contact her without hesitation and
you will see for yourself!"
</p>
<p>— Benjamin Peters, Resident Advisor, Cornell University, worked directly with TT Haswiny at Cornell
University Residential and New Student Programs
</p>
<p>"Haswiny is by far one of the most caring and genuine people I have ever met. She takes the time to get
to know you as a person and really cares about the well-being and success of others. In addition, her work
ethic is simply amazing. She is able to balance a large quantity of work without the quality being affected.
In addition, she is self motivated and self sufficient. There has been many times when a task or deadline was
given and not all the steps were written out. Haswiny needs very little direction to be successful. Furthermore,
she is an amazing team player and really works to make sure the staff in is harmony and working towards our
goals! Her personality of being very approachable and caring combined with her directness allows her to be a
very effective role model and leader!"
</p>
<p>— Karli Sue Buday, Residence Hall Director, Cornell University, managed TT Haswiny at Cornell
University Residential and New Student Programs
</p>
<p>"As a Residential Community Advisor Haswiny was very hardworking, organized, and detail oriented.
Haswiny truly made an effort to get to know each of her residents as she had one of the largest halls.
Her genuineness and authenticity shines on staff as she works well on a team while going above the job
expectations. As a true leader on staff she is the first to reach out a hand if others need help in their role
whether that be fellow Residential Community Advisors or myself as the supervisor."

<p>"Haswiny was a very dedicated RCA when we worked together. I valued her thoughtfulness when dealing
with our many residents. She was very organized with having the information from her residents 1:1s.
She was also a team player, in that she was always willing to do more to help her coworkers if they felt
overwhelmed or just needed some support. "
— Lorayah Lenore, Head Resident for Summer College Program, Cornell University, managed TT
Haswiny at Cornell University
</p>
<p>"TT is brilliant! She is extremely sharp, detail oriented and constantly thinks out of the box. As an intern, TT
needed very little to no direction when it came to market analysis and candidate research for our Executive
Search endeavors. She is a pleasure to work with and raised the bar for our entire HR department. Thanks
to her, we quickly closed a CEO search which we were working on for several months prior to her joining.
Although TT is very early in her career, she is highly knowledgeable and an expert in all things related to
Total Rewards. She left everyone very impressed at her ability to not just comprehend our programs but was
easily able to connect the dots in relation to financial and business wins. A highly impressive woman and true
asset to any team. TT will very quickly be an admired Chief People Officer."

successful in any position she is seeking and I highly recommend her. "
