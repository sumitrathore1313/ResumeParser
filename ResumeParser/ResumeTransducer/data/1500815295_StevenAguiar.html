<p>Summary
I've been hooked on digital publishing since I started my first site, a music blog called Benz and a Backpack,
 in 2009. After graduating from Brown, I went on to create and manage social and digital strategies for MTV
 Hive, The FADER and The Players’ Tribune. Today, I'm using those same skills to help brands build engaged
 audiences as partner and strategy lead at BlueWing.
