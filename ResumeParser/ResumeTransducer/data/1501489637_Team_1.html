<p>The backend code that we produced for the applications is explained in the next section. The code flow charts will help describe the flow of the code. The server and client application is written using Python code as the interface for Raspberry Pi to connect to lights and sensors. The software produced utilizes both the built in functions as well as user defined methods</p>
<p>The following picture gives an overview of how this system is going to work. 
</p>
<p />
<p>�<img src="embedded:image4" alt="image4" /></p>
<p />
<p>The system administrator of the HASS system has the ability to add a new appliance or delete an existing one. The system administrator has the ability to add a new remote device and configure it with HASS or delete an existing one when it is not used. Also the system administrator can create an account for a new user or delete existing account if it is no longer used. </p>
<p />
<h1>Functional Requirement
</h1>
<p>A home appliance control system (HASS) is a system which is controlled by a remote system such as a  mobile phone or a palm-top, and at the same time controls, monitors and coordinates home appliances such as air conditioner, microwave oven, garage doors, TV set, VCR, audio controller, indoor/outdoor lights, water sprinkler, home security system, bath tub controller, etc.</p>
<p />
<p class="ieee_body">In order to activate home appliances and to allow for different ways of cooking, the HASS needs mechanisms for communication between the different devices in the system, and for coordination among the various processes running on such devices.
</p>
<p />
<p class="ieee_body">Note that the HASS needs mechanisms for adapting to different needs of the user as well. For example, when the user is very hungry, the microwave oven may need to respond to the user’s request that it operate maximally to cook the food as fast as it can. For another example, if the user is hungry, tired and may come home late, then the system may be asked to fully cook the meal by the expected arrival time, and periodic warming up every 10 minutes afterwards.
</p>
<p />
<h1>Non-Functional Requirement
</h1>
<h1>Adaptability
</h1>
<p />
<p>The HASS shall be adaptable. Any change is environment shall be detectable, and the HASS shall then be transformable through recognition of the change in HASS needed and the change recognized shall be enacted in the system. The system could be automatically adaptable or manually adaptable. Since speed is of paramount importance for any real-time system, it shall be given a priority comparable to that of the adaptability requirement. This presumably according to the customer needs. Detecting changes in the environment is usually a very time-consuming task, hence hurting speed. Similarly, detection of events could induce significant performance penalty. </p>
<p />
<h1>Safety</h1>
<p>The HASS shall also be safe. For example, the microwave oven should now blow up or become too hot to touch. </p>
<h1>Use Case Diagram
</h1>
<p />
<p>Use case diagrams are intended to model the functional requirements of the system. It shows a set of use cases and actors and their relationships. It is always selected to be the start point of software design. The following figure shows the use case diagram of the HASS system from the end user point of view.

<h1>Use Cases
</h1>
<p />
<p><b>Operate
</b></p>
<p>The use case <i>Operate</i> is a service provided for the users to operate on the devices that are connected to HASS through remote devices. For example, user can send messages of turning on a TV, starting microwave to cook for five minutes, and so forth to HASS and then HASS will perform the action.
</p>
<p />
<p><b>Restart/Redo
</b></p>
<p>The use case <i>Restart/Redo</i> is an extension of the use case <i>Operate</i>. When the HASS could not conduct the command that the user sent, it shall detect and fix the error or restart the device to make it function normally. And the operation will be conducted once more. Besides, the HASS shall inform the user about this exception.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Operate Microwave
</b></p>

<p>The Appliance class shall act as a common parent class to all of the different types of appliances.  The use of a common parent class allows for a certain interface between the HASS controller and the appliances to be enforced.  Enforcing a common interface ensures that the entire system does not need to be recompiled to add a device to the system, but rather that appliances can be added or removed from the system dynamically simply by adding the appliance’s compiled class file to the system’s directory and then instructing the system to add the appliance to the system.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Door/Window, Cooking Appliance, and AV Appliance Class
</b></p>
<p>The Door/Window, Cooking Appliance, and AV Appliance classes serve as an example of the appliance type layer of classes.  These classes will directly inherit from the Appliance class, but will not themselves represent physical appliances.  Rather, this layer serves to enforce a common interface and common properties among a given type of appliance.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Garage Door, Microwave, and Device Classes
</b></p>
<p>The GarageDoor, Microwave, and Device classes are examples of the classes the represent actual physical appliances.  These classes inherit from their respective appliance type class, and thus from the Appliance class.  These classes will contain the actual implementation of the appliance function.  Because all these classes inherit from the same Appliance class, all can be indexed by the HASS system and can be sent commands in the same manner.</p>
<p />
<p><b>HASS Controller Class
</b></p>
<p>The HASS controller class is the heart of the system.  This is the class that controls appliances, devices, and users.  The HASS controller contains an array of appliances, which is the list of all of the appliances on the system.  A command can be sent to an appliance simply by calling that appliance’s SendCommand(string) method.  Each Appliance’s SendCommand(string) method can interpret the command embedded in the string parameter, and will call the appropriate internal methods.  And Appliance’s GetCommands() method returns a list of all of the valid commands for that Appliance, which can then be passed up to the user.  The HASS Controller class also handles interaction between the system and remote devices, and it handles the users logging in and out of the system.  In addition, it handle adding and removing users and devices to/from the system.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Device Class
</b></p>
<p>The Device class represents a physical device used to remotely administer the system.  It contains information on the device itself and the user currently using the device.</p>
<p />
<p><b>User Class
</b></p>
<p>The User class represents a user.  It contains the user’s name and password, whether or not the user has permission to administer the system, and an array of Permissions, indicating which appliances the user may or may not control.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Administrator Class
</b></p>
<p>An instance of the permission class contains one link between a user and an appliance and indicates whether or not that user is allowed to use that appliance.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Permission Class
</b></p>
<p>An instance of the permission class contains one link between a user and an appliance and indicates whether or not that user is allowed to use that appliance.
